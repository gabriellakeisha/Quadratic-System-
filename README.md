# Quadratic-System-
A quadratic function is a second order polynomial which has one turning point and up to two possible roots (i.e. points where the graph cuts the horizontal axis). It can be represented by the formula: 𝑎𝑥^2 + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐
The roots of a quadratic equation can be computed using
𝑥 = −𝑏 ± √𝑏^2-4𝑎𝑐 / 2𝑎, and the number of real roots determined by the discriminant

The program performs:
a) Asking the user to enter the value of the coefficients a, b and c.
b) Calculates the discriminant and then prints the type of roots (i.e. 2 roots, 1 root or no roots) to the screen
c) If roots exist, the program should print the values to the screen
